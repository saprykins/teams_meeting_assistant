# Overview of the Basic Custom Engine Agent template

This app template is built on top of [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/Agents).
It showcases an agent that responds to user questions like ChatGPT. This enables your users to talk with the agent using your custome engine.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22.
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
> - A GitHub account with access to [GitHub Models](https://models.github.ai/).

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your GitHub token `SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>`.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your agent in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the agent.

**Congratulations**! You are running an agent that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground:
